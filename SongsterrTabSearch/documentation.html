            Otherwise, I used Stack Overflow for code consultation and mostly just used the code from the GIF Finder as a basis.

            The page uses Songsterr's web API in order to pull song and artist requests based on input, and returns a link for the respective tab or list of tabs.
            <br>
            The search for a song by name (first search) can be narrowed down by adding the name of the artist in the query. Otherwise, the top result with the containing words will be returned.
            <br>
            The search by artist will return a link to the list of songs by that artist from Songsterr.
            <br>
            While I wanted to create a list of results, the way in which Songsterr returns results ended up being extremely different and difficult to properly handle, and so I was unable to.
            <br>
            The two random buttons will draw from preset arrays of 10 options that I created, and the Top Songs button will return Songsterr's top results/most clicked songs.
            <br>
            The final addition is an Auto-Load button, which will open the result in a new window once a Search button is clicked. This is initially blocked by the pop-up blocker, naturally.
